# Creating a list of hour:minute values 

This is to be used for a drop down. You are to implement a function 
that upon getting a start time (like "12:00"), an end time (like "14:00")
and a duration in minutes will create all the values between the start
and end (inclusive), split into intervals of `duration` minutes.

## Getting started
